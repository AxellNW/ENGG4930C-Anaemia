# ENGG4930 Anaemia

Lack of awareness and insufficient nutrition are two of the causes for the prevalence of anemia in the Dang district. Our project focuses on tackling both issues at once with an educational approach. Our team has been working on two aspects simultaneously: designing interactive curriculum and modifying locally available recipes according to the nutritional needs. The curriculum is complemented by cooking workshops that allow the students to put knowledge into practice. We offer a full package: raising awareness and enhancing understanding through workshops; and cooking sessions allow the kids to have the means to change the status quo.

In our repository, you can understand our project from reading the final report document. You can also find curriculum outline, detailed teaching guides, and post-assessment survey that are related to the design of our overall curriculum; two cooking videos (parantha and chikki), food frequency questionnaire and cooking guidelines are demonstrations of our effort in modifying the recipe and maximizing the necessary nutritional intake.
